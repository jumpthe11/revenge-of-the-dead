## 🤖 AI System

The AI System is a performance-optimized enemy framework that uses simplified weapon mechanics derived from the player's weapon system. Each AI enemy uses a single weapon type and specialized behavior patterns.

### AI Architecture

**Key Principles:**
- **Performance First**: Simplified state machines without complex animations
- **One Weapon Per AI**: Each enemy specializes in a single weapon type
- **Modular Design**: Easy to create new AI types by extending base classes
- **Memory Efficient**: Object pooling and optimized update cycles

### AI Weapon System
**Location**: `AI_System/scripts/ai_weapon_controller.gd`

**Simplified Features:**
- **No Animation Dependencies**: Direct projectile spawning
- **Projectile Pooling**: Reuse projectiles for performance
- **Burst Fire Support**: Configurable burst patterns
- **Range-Based Engagement**: Smart distance management
- **Spread Patterns**: Accuracy simulation without complex calculations

### Advanced Damage System
**Location**: `Player_Controller/scripts/damage_system.gd`

The game features a comprehensive damage calculation system that handles all damage types, friendly fire, armor, and special mechanics.

**Core Features:**
- **Damage Type System**: Bullet, Explosive, Melee, Environmental
- **Source Detection**: Automatically identifies Player, AI Enemy, or Environment sources
- **Friendly Fire Reduction**: Players deal only 10% damage to other players
- **Full Damage**: AI ↔ Player interactions deal 100% damage
- **No AI Friendly Fire**: AI enemies cannot damage each other (0% damage)
- **Armor System**: Optional armor with diminishing returns and type effectiveness
- **Critical Hits**: 5% chance for 2x damage
- **Headshot Multiplier**: 2.5x damage for headshots

**Damage Modifiers:**
```gdscript
# Full damage scenarios
AI → Player: 100% damage
Player → AI: 100% damage
Environment → All: 100% damage

# Reduced damage scenarios  
Player → Player: 10% damage (friendly fire protection)
AI → AI: 0% damage (no AI friendly fire)
```

**Armor Effectiveness by Damage Type:**
- **Bullet Damage**: 100% armor effectiveness
- **Melee Damage**: 70% armor effectiveness  
- **Explosive Damage**: 50% armor effectiveness
- **Environmental Damage**: 30% armor effectiveness

**Usage Example:**
```gdscript
# Apply damage through the damage system
DamageSystem.apply_damage_to_target(
    target,                           # Target node
    50.0,                             # Base damage
    self,                             # Source node
    DamageSystem.DamageType.BULLET,   # Damage type
    direction,                        # Hit direction
    position,                         # Hit position
    true                              # Is headshot
)

# Or calculate damage manually
var final_damage = DamageSystem.calculate_damage(
    50.0,                             # Base damage
    source_node,                      # Source
    target_node,                      # Target
    DamageSystem.DamageType.EXPLOSIVE # Damage type
)
```

### Enemy-Player Combat System

**Damage Compatibility:**
The game uses a unified damage system compatible between enemies and the player:

**Player Requirements:**
- Must be in both "Player" and "Target" groups
- Must implement `Hit_Successful(damage, Direction, Position)` method
- Must implement `take_damage(damage, source)` method
- Optional: `apply_knockback(knockback_vector)` method for knockback effects
- Optional: `get_armor_value()` method for armor system integration

**Enemy Damage Types:**
1. **Ranged Weapons**: AI uses weapon controller with projectiles that call damage system
2. **Melee Attacks**: Melee brutes call damage system directly when in range
3. **Explosions**: Death explosions and area damage use explosive damage type
4. **All damage** is processed through `DamageSystem` for proper modifiers

**How It Works:**
- All projectiles track their source (player or AI enemy)
- When hitting a target, projectiles call `DamageSystem.apply_damage_to_target()`
- `DamageSystem` calculates final damage based on:
  - Source type (Player/AI/Environment)
  - Target type (Player/AI)
  - Damage type (Bullet/Melee/Explosive/Environmental)
  - Target armor (if present)
  - Special modifiers (headshot, critical hit)
- Applies friendly fire reduction (10% for player-to-player)
- Prevents AI friendly fire (0% damage)
- Calls `Hit_Successful()` or `take_damage()` with calculated damage
- Results in health reduction, knockback, and potential death

### Available AI Types

- Trail emitter component for physics projectiles

**AI Resource Loading Fixes:**
- Fixed custom resource type references in .tres and .tscn files
- Changed `type="AIWeaponResource"` to `type="Resource"` in scene files (Godot doesn't support custom types in ExtResource)
- Removed `type="AIWeaponResource"` from .tres resource headers
- Removed projectile scene dependencies from AI weapons (AI uses direct raycasting, doesn't need player projectile scenes)
- Set `projectile_scene = null` in weapon resources and changed `load_steps` to 2
- AI weapon resources now load correctly
- Fixed shotgun rusher movement - now moves even if weapon resource fails to load

**AI Visual Improvements:**
- Added weapon models to AI enemies for visual feedback
- Rifle Soldier holds blasterL (long rifle model)
- Shotgun Rusher holds blasterD (close-range weapon model)
- Melee Brute has no weapon (melee only)
- Weapon models positioned as children of WeaponController node

### Recent Updates (2025-10-15)

**AI System Critical Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed AI enemies floating to the sky - added proper gravity application
- Fixed AI enemies not shooting - multiple issues resolved:
  - Fixed rifle_ai_weapon.tres UID mismatch (scene expected different UID than resource file)
  - Fixed burst fire logic - fire timer now correctly allows shots within bursts
  - Replaced player projectile system with direct AI raycast (player projectiles use camera, not world direction)
  - AI now does direct hitscan from their position instead of using player's camera-based projectiles
  - Added auto-find logic for WeaponController and DetectionArea child nodes
  - Fixed _ready() call order in shotgun_rusher and melee_brute (must call super._ready() first)
  - Added null checks for weapon_controller and weapon_resource in all methods
- Fixed all AI types (Rifle Soldier, Shotgun Rusher, Melee Brute) movement bugs
- All AI enemies now properly affected by gravity and move correctly on ground
- Velocity now properly separated into x/z (horizontal) and y (vertical) components

**Pathfinding System:**
- No pathfinding currently implemented - AI uses direct movement toward player
- Simple approach is sufficient for open areas and maintains good performance
- For future implementation with hundreds of enemies:
  - Stagger pathfinding updates across multiple frames
  - Use simplified paths for distant enemies
  - Only use full pathfinding when direct line-of-sight is blocked
  - Consider NavigationAgent3D with async pathfinding for large enemy counts
  - Update paths every 0.5-1.0 seconds instead of every frame
